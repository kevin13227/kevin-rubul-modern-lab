              <strong>Dr. Rubul Mout</strong> is a Fellow (Research) at Harvard Medical School, Harvard University, 
              and the Stem Cell & Regenerative Biology Program, Boston Children's Hospital (BCH).

            <p className="text-gray-900">
              Born, and educated in India, Dr. Mout moved to the United States to pursue his PhD 
              from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Prior to joining Harvard/BCH, he was a Washington 
              Research Foundation Innovation Fellow at the Institute for Protein Design, University of Washington.

            <p className="text-gray-900">
              At Harvard/BCH, Dr. Mout developed soluble agonists for the Notch signaling pathway for T cell 
              development and function. These agonists promoted the development of T cells from bone marrow stem 
              cells and activated the Notch pathway in T cells during vaccination to boost cell-based immunity.

            <p className="text-gray-900">
              Currently, Dr. Mout uses computational protein design technologies to modulate signaling in immune 
              development, function, and ageing. The ultimate goal of this research is to enhance T cell function 
              to better combat cancer, autoimmune diseases, and viral infections.

            <p className="text-gray-900">
              Dr. Mout is the co-author of 40 research articles and the inventor of numerous
              technologies in gene editing, protein design, and T-cell engineering with multiple
              patents. During his PhD, he developed a technology for intracellular protein delivery and
              gene editing in mammalian cells, known as the 'E-tag' method, which was published in
              a series of multiple research papers and an approved patent. His work on protein
              design and Notch signaling in collaboration with his former postdoctoral mentor David
              Baker (2024 Nobel Laureate in Chemistry), George Daley (Dean, Harvard Medical
              School), and others was featured in Nature magazine. In addition, his research has
              been featured in numerous media, including a LabTV/NIH minidocumentary and an
              American Chemical Society (ACS) feature video.

              Dr. Mout is also the author of two books in Assamese, a memoir and a collection of short stories. His memoir depicts his journey from a poor 
              peasant's family in a far-remote corner of India, near the Assam-Arunachal border.
            </p>
            <p>
              The memoir, Moro Eta Sapon Ase, has been an instant bestseller, and since its first publication in 2017 it has 
              sold over 50,000 copies (as of January 2025), making it one of the highest-selling books 
              in the Assamese language. The book is also included in many school/college/university 
              curriculums across Assam.
